### Objective 
- I will make a news website that will let user search news from any city they want to see.

#### Reflection

### Day 1: Project Initialization and API Selection

- I used an api from https://gnews.io/ to get data from each city I search up.

# Blockers 
- city news wouldn't display.

# Solution
- I solved the first blocker by realizing I had a typo in my code.

### Day 2: API Integration and Class Implementation

# Blockers
- None
